ThisService-examples
====================

This repo contains example code built for Mac OS X's Services
interface with an assist from ThisService.

Services are text trasformation gizmos. ThisService makes it easy to
write Services in scripting languages.

The examples here are:

* Remove linebreaks: When you paste text into a website, often you end
up with breakage thanks to the linebreaks in the input. This service
replaces the selected text with text that has no linebreaks, and as a
bonus, turns tabs (which sometimes spontaneously appear in pasted
text) into a space.

* Email me: Send the selected text to me in an email, with a single
click. I send myself a lot of email.
